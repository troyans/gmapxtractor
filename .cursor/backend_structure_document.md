# Backend Structure Document

This document explains our backend setup in everyday language. It covers our backend architecture, hosting, database design, API endpoints, and more. This guide is meant for anyone interested in understanding how our project—designed to extract contact data from Google Maps—works behind the scenes.

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend is designed to be simple, fast, and scalable. We use industry-standard design patterns to ensure the system can grow with our needs and remain easy to maintain. Below are the main components and design strategies:

*   **Separation of Concerns:** We have clear boundaries between different parts like authentication, data scraping, and data management.

*   **Frameworks and Tools:**

    *   **Node.js** for running our web scraper using Puppeteer or Playwright.
    *   **Supabase** manages our database, storage, and user authentication.

*   **Scalability & Performance:**

    *   The architecture supports growth by allowing each component (scraping, data processing, authentication) to scale independently.
    *   We use pattern designs that encourage code reuse and easy updates, ensuring the system stays efficient even with increased loads.

*   **Maintainability:**

    *   We keep the code modular so that it's easy to isolate and fix issues without impacting the entire system.

## 2. Database Management

We manage our data using a mix of modern database technologies that suit the needs of our application. Here’s how:

*   **Database Technology:** Supabase is our primary solution which provides:

    *   A **SQL database** for structured data storage.
    *   Built-in support for relational data, which is ideal for handling users, scraped data, and logs.

*   **Data Structure & Access:**

    *   Information is organized into logical tables that store user details, the results of scraping operations, and audit logs.
    *   Data is accessed securely using Supabase's APIs to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can retrieve or modify the data.

*   **Data Management Practices:**

    *   Regular backups and strict data integrity checks
    *   Use of encryption for data both in transit and at rest.

## 3. Database Schema

Our SQL database organizes data in tables that are easy to understand. Below is an overview of the main tables and how they relate to one another:

*   **Users Table:** Tracks user account details and their role (e.g., sales manager or salesperson).

    *   Contains fields like user ID, name, email, password hash, and role.

*   **Scraped Data Table:** Holds results from Google Maps scraping operations.

    *   Contains fields such as data ID, scraped contact details (emails, phone numbers, social media links), associated business name, and timestamp.

*   **Audit Log Table:** Records all user actions and scraping activities for compliance and debugging.

    *   Contains fields like log ID, action performed, user ID, timestamp, and additional metadata.

The tables are linked in such a way that every smell operation and user action is tracked and can be cited; the relational structure ensures data consistency and easy retrieval.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

Our API connects the frontend with the backend, enabling smooth and secure data exchange. Here’s how it works:

*   **API Style:** We follow a RESTful approach. All endpoints are designed to be intuitive and self-contained.

*   **Key Endpoints Include:**

    *   **Authentication Endpoints:** For secure login, registration, and role-based access using Supabase.
    *   **Scraping Trigger Endpoint:** Allows users to initiate the scraping process manually while ensuring compliance with rate limiting and ethical guidelines.
    *   **Data Retrieval Endpoints:** For fetching scraped data, with options to filter, sort, and paginate data.
    *   **CSV Export Endpoint:** Lets users select columns and filters before exporting the data into a CSV file.
    *   **Audit and Logging Endpoints:** These endpoints capture and provide logs for user activities and scraping events, key for monitoring and compliance.

Each endpoint is designed to be secure and efficient, with clear error handling for issues like invalid inputs or network problems.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

We host our backend in an environment that supports scalability, security, and efficiency. Here’s a look at our hosting setup:

*   **Cloud-Based Hosting:**

    *   **Supabase:** Provides hosting for our SQL database, user authentication, and storage solutions.
    *   **Cloud Functions/Serverless:** For running web scraping tasks using Node.js. This ensures that resources are used efficiently, scaling up as needed when users initiate scraping.

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Reliability:** Cloud hosting ensures that our services remain available with minimal downtime.
    *   **Scalability:** The solution can dynamically adjust to handle peak loads without manual intervention.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-as-you-go pricing allows us to manage costs prudently while still maintaining high performance.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

Our backend includes several infrastructure components that work together to ensure high performance:

*   **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming requests evenly across our backend resources, ensuring no single point of failure.
*   **Caching Mechanisms:** Use of cache (in-memory stores or CDN caching) to speed up repeated data access and reduce database load.
*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Deliver static assets quickly to users globally, improving load times.
*   **Serverless Functions:** Execute the scraping operations and other compute-intensive tasks in a scalable manner.

Each of these components is chosen to enhance the overall user experience by providing fast, reliable, and secure services.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a top priority. Our backend employs several measures to keep data safe:

*   **Authentication & Authorization:**

    *   User sign-in, registration, and role-based access control are managed using Supabase, ensuring only the right users can access certain functions.

*   **Data Encryption:**

    *   Encrypt data in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest in our database to protect sensitive information.

*   **Rate Limiting:**

    *   Control the frequency of scraping tasks to avoid abuse and comply with ethical guidelines.

*   **Audit Trails & Logging:**

    *   Track all system actions and user interactions to quickly identify and respond to potential security issues.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Adhere to data privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA, ensuring that user data is handled with care.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Keeping an eye on the system's health and performance is essential. Here’s what we do:

*   **Monitoring Tools:**

    *   Use built-in Supabase monitoring and third-party tools for real-time tracking of server performance, error rates, and user activities.

*   **Logging:**

    *   Comprehensive logging systems capture every operation, making it easier to debug issues or track unusual activities.

*   **Maintenance Strategies:**

    *   Regular updates to code and dependencies
    *   Routine data backups and integrity checks
    *   Scheduled reviews of the system for security and performance improvements

These practices ensure that the backend is both reliable today and adaptable for future needs.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

To sum up, our backend is built with scalability, security, and maintainability in mind. We use a mix of modern tools and best practices to ensure that the system performs well and remains dependable. Here are the highlights:
