# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user visits the tool, they are greeted by a clean landing page that emphasizes simplicity and security. Here, the user sees an introduction to the tool's purpose of extracting contact information from Google Maps listings for sales purposes. The page explains the benefits and compliance measures in place regarding ethical scraping. The user is offered multiple methods to create an account including a form-based sign-up using email and password, as well as options for social login to make registration quick and convenient. For those who have already registered, a prominent login option is available. In case a user forgets their password, there is an easily accessible password recovery flow that guides them through identity verification and password reset. Once authentication succeeds, regardless of the chosen method, the system securely logs the user in and records the activity for auditing purposes.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful sign-in, the user is directed to the main dashboard which serves as the central hub of the application. The layout is minimalist and welcoming, featuring a well-organized header with navigation options, a sidebar for quick access to different sections of the tool, and a content area dedicated to the current operation. The home screen prominently displays input fields for entering a location and search keywords. There is a clearly labeled search button that users press to initiate the scraping process. Additionally, quick links on the dashboard allow users to review previous search results, access account settings, review logs, or visit support pages. Overall, the dashboard is designed to be intuitive so that users can easily navigate to every feature offered by the application without feeling overwhelmed.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Upon initiating a search from the home screen, the user is immediately taken through a series of connected actions. The first step involves entering a location and one or more keywords related to sales or business interests. Once the search button is pressed, the application triggers a backend process using Node.js libraries such as Puppeteer or Playwright. This process is designed to scrape Google Maps listings while carefully respecting rate limits and ethical guidelines of usage. During the scraping process, the user is kept informed with a progress indicator and notifications that the operation is running and logged for compliance and debug purposes.

After the scraping completes, the user is automatically transitioned to the results page. On this page, the data extracted from Google Maps is displayed in a sortable and filterable table format. The table is designed to be user-friendly: each row represents a listing with columns for email, phone number, social media links, and other relevant details. The page allows for additional interactions such as selecting specific rows to view more detailed information or trigger AI insights that offer summaries and engagement suggestions. Users can click on particular table entries that expand to show more information and options for contacting potential leads.

From the results page, users have a clear option to export the data. The CSV export interface is integrated into the same page and offers customization. Users can manually choose which columns they want to include and can apply further filters to tailor the dataset before downloading it. Once the export is completed, users are presented with a confirmation that their CSV file is ready for download and further use in other sales tools.

The application also incorporates advanced workflows such as audit trail reviews for administrators and role-based access to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive logs and settings. Each page transition is smooth and is designed to ensure that users remain oriented throughout their journey from input to final data export.

## Settings and Account Management

Users looking to manage their account or modify personal details can easily access a dedicated settings area from the main navigation menu. Within this section, the user finds options to update profile information such as name, email, and password, as well as configure preferences for notifications and data privacy. The settings page also includes a billing section where users can view subscription details if applicable, change their plan, or update payment methods. Any changes made in account settings are saved securely and the activity is logged. Once the user completes their adjustments, an intuitive back button or main menu link is provided to return them seamlessly to the home screen or dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

In case a user inputs invalid data or tries to perform an action that is not allowed, the application provides clear and straightforward error messages. For example, if the search fields are left blank prior to initiating scraping, the system displays a prompt asking for the required inputs before proceeding. Should a network error occur during the scraping process, the user is immediately informed with a friendly message explaining the issue and suggestions for checking their connection. Similarly, if an action is attempted that violates the ethical scraping norms or exceeds permitted search limits, an alert is displayed detailing the restrictions and advising the user accordingly. In all cases, the tool ensures that error messages maintain a simple language that helps users quickly return to the normal flow without confusion.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey of the application starts with a secure, intuitive sign-up or log-in process that ensures compliance and proper role assignment. Once authenticated, the users are welcomed by a clear home dashboard that guides them effortlessly to input their search criteria. From there, the journey advances through a smartly designed scraping process that respects all ethical and legal guidelines, culminating in a results page where data is presented in an orderly table with robust customization options. Advanced features like AI insights and CSV exports enhance the functionality further. The application is built with user experience in mind by offering clear navigation throughout settings and managing error states to ensure users can quickly resolve issues. In short, the tool simplifies the collection and processing of data from Google Maps listings, ensuring an end-to-end experience that is both secure and user-friendly for sales professionals.
